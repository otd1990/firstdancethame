            I have been dancing since I was two years old. Following a short
            experience with a very structured toddler group, my parents decided
            I might be better placed in Ballet, as during the group all I wanted
            to do was get up and perform in front of all of the other children
            and parents… (much to the organisers frustration, as this meant the
            other children followed my lead oops!)

            The class was great but did not allow room for my free spirited
            nature, when I heard music all I wanted was to dance and so my
            journey began…

            After proudly collecting my I.S.T.D (Imperial Society Teachers of
            Dance) graded and vocational examination certificates, I was lucky
            enough to be accepted into vocational training at Northern Ballet
            School (Manchester, UK). During this time I studied Ballet, Tap,
            Modern, Jazz, Street Dance, Musical Theatre and Contemporary dance.
            I am now almost complete in my I.S.T.D DDE (Diploma in Dance
            Education), to further my teaching expertise and enable me to enter
            my students for examination, just as I undertook all those years
            ago.

            I am also mum to my wonderful daughter, who is quickly following in
            my footsteps at only two years old!
