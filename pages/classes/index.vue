            It is my belief that whilst structure and discipline are important,
            there is the greatest need for children to be able to express
            themselves creatively without restriction, have confidence in making
            their own decisions and most of all have fun! This is where First
            dance comes in, whether you are a beginner or advanced level
            student; we offer a unique opportunity for students to use dance in
            a way that inspires them, shows their personality and gives them
            true confidence in their ability.
